# Machine-Learning-Classifiers
Work done on Machine Learning projects

In this example, Probabilistic and Non probabilistic classifiers are compared and ROC curve are examined.

We use Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, as well as simply predicting one label.

We simply classify a "yes" or "no" answer based on given Bank data.
